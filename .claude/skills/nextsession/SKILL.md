read HANDOVER.md and follow the instructions. Ask me if you have any questions.

Our general coding rules live in docs/llm/golden_rules.md — read and honour them. On top of those, follow this session workflow:

1. All tests must pass before committing, unless I explicitly give permission otherwise. Run the suite with `uv run pytest`.
2. Before you start working, make sure HANDOVER.md and ROADMAP.md represent the current state of progress and are up to date. If not, update them before you start.
3. Avoid technical debt — if you find an error, fix it when possible; otherwise lodge it as an issue on GitHub.
4. When you are done, update HANDOVER.md and ROADMAP.md to reflect the current state of development and progress. Prune both to stay concise and under 500 lines if possible: focus on what still needs doing, and summarise briefly what has already been done. If you are not sure how to do this, ask me.
5. When the task is complete, commit all changes, push, and open a PR to the main branch. Link the PR to the relevant GitHub issue if applicable, and include a clear description of the changes made and any relevant context for reviewers. If you are not sure how to do this, ask me.
